This repository contains the backend code for a corporate asset management website named "**AssetMasterHub**". The code is based on the Django framework and serves as the source code for my course project in the Software Engineering class at Tsinghua University.

The frontend code is in https://github.com/fansunqi/AssetMasterHub-frontend. The frontend and backend of the project can communicate with each other.
